      body: |
        This change multiplexes streams, creating additional streams that invert
        the query to stream for linked data.
        The query is introspected and if it traverse links, the corresponding
        relationship is found and used to generate and inversion of the query,
        which is then streamed.
        When the inverse stream gets a result, the even is inverted again to
        produce the expected event emission.

      hash: 2e38485c75725c0037e2d2efb5bad14a27c77fe7
      body: |
        With this change, autumndb sessions are now expected to be objects
        containing the actor and an optional scope directly instead of a string
        referring to the session contract. Validating session contracts
        should now be handled by the implementing app layer.
        This means that autumndb is only dealing with identity, instead of
        partially handling auth.

        Setting the hash to an invalid hash disables login indirectly. This is
        usually done by setting the hash to the constant `PASSWORDLESS` but the
        same effect can be achieved with other strings. Some tests and a few
        contracts on live do this so we need to check if the hash at least looks
        valid.

        it was linked with previously. Every update causes a lock

        This change ensures that the initial value for tags is kept when
        aggregating tags.

        Previously, if a tag was added directly, it would be overriden by the

        AGGREGATE.

      hash: a30e09e3a502d37251e9f146baa326ce00212f6c
      body: |
        This change adds a simple unit test to sanity check the formula used for
        aggregating values in the `withEvents()` mixin. This change highlights
        that the core should probably not be providing mixins, especialy with
        functionality that it doesn't provide or handle directly ($$formula
        fields). In the future we should consider hoisting mixins into the
        worker module to improve feature seperation and make the system less
        brittle.

        `$events` is a shorthand for getting whisper and message contracts from

        a timeline, and will be deprecated in future versions of Jellyscript.

        The current implementation of `$events` uses a standalone AST parsing algorithm which

        needs to be removed.

      hash: 8388f93dfa8eca0fab82015771844f77b8ab6237
      body: |
        This changes the guest user role so that it can only view the guest user
        contract. This change goes hand-in-hand with updates to the worker
        service that add special routes for login and password reset.
        See https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/pull/7774

      hash: 83cdba9f77941d7cbbd42ec73e40ea84a109e6eb
      body: |
        The current signature defines that the method returns a partial contract
        while in fact it returns a full contract with only the ID undefined.

        Unfortunately this is a major change as it is necessary to change the
        generic arguments.

    - subject: Rationalize how database connections and transactions are used
      hash: 41f458b874db826bc9f94ad00a70e35d8eb101f5
      body: |
        The current connection or transaction is now part of the `Context` class
        along with the log context, and the database can only be interacted with
        through a `Context` object.

        There are some incidental changes related to this work:

        - Refer to a connection pool as a pool instead of a "connection" in the
          backend.
        - Replace `pg-promise` with `pg`. `pg-promise` is a thin layer on top of
          `pg` and it is causing problems with its incomplete typings and, uh,
          unique approach to transactions: you cannot use a connection after
          ending a transaction with it.

        And to reduce the number of major versions this also includes:

        - Removal of the `Kernel.errors` and `Kernel.cards` fields and
          privatization of the `sessions` field. Access to first two fields can
          be replaced by by the exported `errors` module and `CARDS` constant.
          The admin session can be retrieved through the `adminSession` method.
        - The `Kernel.backend` field is now private. `withPostgres` returns the
          connection pool that can be used by external code that must connect to
          the same database.

        Plus some minor internal reorganization.

      hash: 92fefe6b037088a00868d58e454a1c20356d4b27
      body: |
        `testUtils` has a `TestContext` that contains the three pieces necessary
        to run tests against the core:

        - The log context.
        - The admin session token.
        - The `Kernel` object.

        `generateRandomId` (notice the change in capitalization) and
        `generateRandomSlug` are not part of the context anymore. They are now
        functions exported from the `testUtils` module.

        Other test contexts that depend on the core's should extend
        `TestContext` and use `newContext` and `destroyContext`.

        - Remove the `core*` prefix from exported symbols.

        - Replace the `create` function with a static method in the `Kernel`:
          `withPostgres`.
        - `Kernel.initialize` now takes a `LogContext` instead of a
          `MixedContext` as it doesn't make sense for it to accept a `Context`
          object.
        - Update `jellyfish-types` to v2 and use the new `JsonSchema` type.

      hash: 82d78dd87e93d386900d4e385aac7a620c0a42c8
      body: |
        The subquery that builds the final contract tree when querying with
        links uses an inner join to get the nested link. Roughly:

        ```
        JOIN (
          // Build the linked contract...
        ) AS linked
        ON edge.source = linked.id
        ```

        These joins are nested in the case of nested links and there is a
        toplevel `LATERAL`. In the case of two nested optional links, the
        `LATERAL` subquery looks roughly like this:

        ```
        FROM
          cards,
          LATERAL (
            // ...
            JOIN (
              // ...
            ) AS linked
            ON edge1.source = linked.id
            // ...
          )
        WHERE edge0.source = cards.id
        ```

        If the optional contracts don't exist, `linked.id` will be null and the
        `edge1.to = linked.id` condition will fail. As a consequence, the whole
        lateral will be empty and so will the result. The fix is change those
        inner joins into left joins.

        This is a tentative fix because I have fuzzy memories of making this
        exact change and causing unrelated tests to fail.

      hash: 522f21e00e63929766c8a1a105484c049975331f
      body: |
        Currently, many functions take an argument called `context`. This is
        simply an arbitrary object that should be passed as first argument to
        calls into the logging or assert libraries. This commit introduces a
        `Context` class that encapsulates the logging context. It also exposes
        logging and assert functions so that, for example, calls like
        `logger.info(context, ...` are replaced by `context.info(...`.

        In the future the `Context` class will carry more than just the log
        context.

        This is the first step in preparation for a refactor on how JF handles

    - subject: Safely handle simultaneous creation of identical indexes
      hash: 48400d6992e96e9146e1d9e2cfa6e57045c0252d
      body: >
        If two instances run this function simultaneously, it's possible to
        enter a race condition

        where the index creation will fail with an error, as one instance will create the index

        before the other. Ideally we want a unified way of handling system bootstrapping, but for now we

        can simply retry once on a failure and check again to see if the index already exists.

      hash: bb793d5f85912fe4ac40b65092f16987b09b2a04
      body: >
        These tests are mostly an adaptation of the jellyfish repo tests, which

        test at the wrong abstraction level. By testing at the kernel level we

        ensure the gaurantess of the kernel interface and avoid unintended

        breakages.

        See https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/blob/v38.2.3/test/e2e/server/full-text-search.spec.js

        The special case testing for querying action requests is unnecessary.

        Action request contracts are stored and retrieved by the kernel exactly the same as

        any other contract.

        Using the @sindresorhus/slugify module was causing a lot of headaches as
        it is shipped as an esm module and requires additional compiler and jest
        config. The additional effort wasn't worth the convenience, so I decided
        to replace it with a simple inline statement that is functionally the
        same.

      hash: 7dc042acd0dbfe2a186010b566f76a2da51e32cd
      body: |
        Previously slugs were required, and `action-create-card` would
        automatically generate the slug. This change moves the slug generation
        into the core (which I think makes more sense) and also improves the
        slug generation by removing stop words and only using a short uuid if
        there is a name available.
        Note that a test was removed here, as the assertion it made is now
        covered by the type signature on the `insertCard` method.

    - subject: "`LinkFilter.scrapLinksInto()` should not recurse."
      hash: cdc30113f390449e40dbab1c95c9c3a0a06fa4ed
      body: |
        The `scrapLinksInto` method is meant to gather `LinkFilter` objects from
        a filter tree when that filter tree is simplified out. For example,
        through constant folding. This mechanism allows optional links since
        links that are mentioned in the original schema will be fetched even if
        all filters mentioning them are optimized out.

        `scrapLinksInto` is only called by `ExpressionFilter`, and only during
        optimization, to build a list of optional links. Previously,
        `LinkFilter` would also call `scrapLinksInto` of its own filter but that
        does not make sense as doing so breaks nesting between `LinkFilter`s. If
        a `LinkFilter` `a` had another `LinkFilter` `b` nested directly or not,
        and `a.scrapLinksInto()` called in turn `b.scrapLinksInto()`, that would
        duplicate `b` at the same nesting level as `a`.

        While this oversight should only cause suboptimal SQL queries to be
        generated when `$$links` are nested, it causes an error when two
        optional links are nested due to how `ExpressionFilter.scrapLinksInto()`
        is implemented, leading to the nested link being completely moved to the
        wrong nesting level instead of just duplicated at the wrong level. This
        in turn leads to invalid references in the resulting SQL.

        Fixes #925

    - subject: Ensure that backend types are included in compiled build
      hash: f1bf0920369994b81301a95d158664175a0d279a
      body: |
        With our tsc configuration, `*.d.ts` files are ignored by the compiler
        and won't be copied across to the output directory, this causes problems
        when downstream projects are trying to use types defined here.
        This change simply changes the extension to `.ts`, causing the file to
        be included in the build output.

        See https://stackoverflow.com/a/56440335 for more detail

      hash: 441f31761704581dec2fbb857a71654ce18e9472
      body: >
        Treat loop just like we do with the optional name field.


        Note - we already validate the loop field in the kernel so this shouldn't be a problem in practice but it's worth being consistent and safe at the backend level as well.

      body: >2
         number of jellyfish modules import these objects from subpaths, which is an abomination.
        It also makes converting said modules to typescript much more difficult.

        Once everything is converted to typescript this situation needs to be straightened out.

    - subject: Correctly deal with queries that select nothing inside JSONB objects
      hash: 84ca1e987fd54f9b1065b6a3946be1ade41294cb
      body: |
        When `additionalProperties: false`, JSONB content selection works
        subtractively, first by fetching the whole object and then removing all
        keys that were not explicitly selected. If no keys were selected at all,
        the compiler would generate a query over `VALUES ()` which is not valid
        SQL. This fix prevents subtraction from happening in this case,
        replacing the expression with an empty JSONB object.

        Fixes https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/issues/6191

        Fixes https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/issues/5884


        Due to the way some queries for links are converted/optimized into SQL, it is necessary to index on the name field as well. Tested manually on production and verified this massively speeds up the slow queries.

        If there isn't a registed listener for an EventEmitter "error" event, an

        exception will be raised and the nodeJS process will exit: see https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_error_events

        This change adds a listener for the "error" event, and creates a log

        message to prevent the process from crashing.

      hash: 6afc2f4eca1f9825f4fdbc52d085713d17c38562
      body: >
        This index was added recently to facilitate searching for users by slug
        in a full text search query. But this isn't very sensible as it requires
        the user to include the `user-` prefix in the search term - which they
        will never (want to) do! So I'm removing the fullTextSearch index and
        the CreateView lens will manually search for the user by slug using a
        regex search.
